# Combination Generator
The Combination Generator is a Python script designed to generate all possible combinations of letters and numbers from a given input string. This tool allows you to specify the length of the combinations you wish to generate. The script organizes the generated combinations into text files within a designated folder, with each file named after the original input string.
